# Windows Server Performance Tips

> ℹ️ **Hardware Configuration**
> By default the ISO sets 2x vCores and only 2 GB of vRAM which is the absolute BARE minium to run the Server.
> Best practice is to adjust the Cores to: 4x vCores
> And the vRAM to: 4 GB

> ℹ️ **Server Power Options**
> It is not much, but switch to the High Performance Mode within the Power Management Console.
> Additionally disable all Tranceparancy Effects.
